## Blackjack Project

### Project Description
The project is a standard Blackjack program that is an extension of card games. Multiple different games can be constructed from the common objects.
Rank, suit, Card, and Hand are common objects that can be implemented in different card games. The BlackjackHandSim was specifically designed for the Blackjack card game. The game consists of a player and a dealer, who wins when opening with 21 or otherwise called "Blackjack". The player can either either hit or stand on their turn. Once the player stays the dealer checks their hand and automatically hits a card when the score is below 17. The score are compared at the end and the highest score wins.
